This project is focused on the control and monitoring of plant pests and diseases. Especially focused on agriculture, for the detection and geolocation of these infections, and to avoid their spread.

It generates a Liquid Galaxy visualization from data gathered from devices on the field used by the farmers that are able to examine the leaves of the plants looking for any defects caused by these diseases.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

TensorFlow (Machine Learning Model, Image Recognition)
Google Coral Acelerador USB (Tensor Process Unit)
Jetson Nano 2 GB (GPU Process Unit)
Liquid Galaxy 
3D printing 

The visualization comes directly from a device that has a IoT and Edge Computing concept, and in a future it might also work 5G technology. The device use an AI model programmed with Tensorflow running on a Nvidia GPU helped by a coral USB accelerator tpu to make the inference faster, evaluating in real time at the field the photos of plants leaves with their various defects and it gives the result of the health evaluation. 

The results can be processed and sent to our maps platform to locate the infected plants in the territory with the purpose of quickly combating these pests with the least possible waste. This is where the liquid galaxy technology has its main use, for a better interaction and visualization of the disease in the crops.
